# UiPathGoogleScrapping

This solution will help to fetch category and subcategory wise data on city basis, currently i mapped this with all cities of India, 
It will prompt to select Cities and then ask to select Category and then SubCategory.

Now in sub-category you have add or bydefault it will select from Excel sheet which i mapped with it, here you have to make sure that sub-category should be COMMA
seperated.

Once you select above values via dropdown then it will open chrome as Google Map, and start fetching record. Kindly note here, it will be fetching data on paging.

So, once sub-categories search finishes it create by Export folder in your c drive, please change as per your need.

If you have any input to add please let me know i will explore.
